Ubi

An unofficial Ubuntu One app for Maemo 5 and other Qt-enabled platforms.

The Ubi app provides access to Ubuntu One cloud service. Initial version supports simple storage management tasks like: file Download, Upload and Deletion. The plan is to provide other cloud features i.e. Notes editing and Contact synchronization.

The code is mostly done in Qt Quick so hopefully it can be easily migrated to Symbian or MeeGo platforms.
